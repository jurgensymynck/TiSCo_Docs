= SPEC-001: Teach-in Servo Controller (TiSCo)
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The project involves a robotic control system called Teach-in Servo Controller (TiSCo) running on Arduino Mega 2560 and Adafruit Grand Central M4 Express (featuring the SAMD51 chip). It communicates bidirectionally with the outside world using serial packet data. The system includes multiple joints and servos, and it needs to be initialized, calibrated, and operated safely.

== Introduction:
// Provides a high-level overview of the project.

=== Purpose
// A brief description of the purpose of the project.
// The goals and objectives of the project.

The project offers a straightforward and consistent method for activating various complex mechanisms using hobby servos. A significant feature, often missing in most hobby robot control software, is the Teach-in functionality. This allows users to manually manipulate the robot joints in real time, recording the joint angles as the robot is guided through its movements. Once the input is processed, the robot can accurately replay the recorded motions at any desired speed. This capability enables the execution of extensive and complex motions without requiring advanced robotics theories such as Inverse Kinematics.

=== Scope
//  The scope of the project, including what will and will not be included.

- The scope of the project includes the development of motion control algorithms, calibration settings, and input/output management.
- Exclusions: The project does not cover the manufacturing of hardware components or the development of a user interface beyond basic command inputs.

- **Can**: Possibility and Capability.
    * Possibility: expression that conveys expected or conceivable material, physical or causal outcome.
    * Capability: expression that conveys the ability, fitness, or quality necessary to do or achieve a specified thing.

- **Must**: External constraint. Constraint or obligation on the user of the document (e.g. laws of nature or particular conditions existing in some countries or regions) that is not stated as a provision of the document. Note: Use of the word "must" does not imply that the external constraint referred to is a requirement of the document.
